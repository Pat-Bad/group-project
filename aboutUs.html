    <h1>About Pawtect™</h1>
<p>At Pawtect™, we believe your home should be both beautiful and pet-ready. Born from the chaos of living with curious cats and the desire to keep our spaces intact, Pawtect™ was founded with a simple mission:
protect what matters—without sacrificing comfort or style.<br>

We design premium, modern products that stand up to your cat’s wild side. Whether it's claw-happy furniture attacks, accidental spills, or midnight zoomies across your houseplants, we’ve got a sleek solution. Our products blend durability with design, so your space stays safe and stylish—without looking like a fortress.</p>

<h2>🐾 What We Make:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scratch-resistant sofa wraps</li>
<li>Spill-proof keyboard covers</li>
<li>Invisible window films to stop curtain climbers</li>
<li>Plant protection rings that deter digging</li>
</ul>


<p>...and other clever creations your cat won’t destroy.</p>

<h3>Pawtect™ is for people who love their cats—and their space. Our products are created with real homes (and real cats) in mind, tested for resilience, and made to blend seamlessly with your lifestyle.</h3>
